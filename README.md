This is a **Computer Vision-based Identity Verification** project that utilizes facial recognition technology to authenticate the identity of a person based on their face image and other factors. The application can compare face images against a database of known identities to verify an individual’s identity in real-time. It uses deep learning models and image processing techniques to ensure robust performance and accuracy.

## 🧩 **System Architecture**

### High-Level Architecture:


### Components:
1. **Face Detection**: Uses OpenCV or Dlib to detect faces in images or video frames.
2. **Face Embeddings**: Extracts facial features (embeddings) using deep learning models (like ResNet or VGGFace).
3. **Face Matching**: Compares the extracted embeddings with the stored embeddings in the database for identity verification.
4. **Identity Database**: Stores facial features of known individuals, stored securely in a database.
5. **Backend API**: Provides endpoints to interact with the system (upload face images, request verification).
6. **Frontend UI** (optional): Allows users to upload images or interact with the system via a web interface.
